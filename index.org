* Course description

  The Fukaya category is a sophisticated invariant of symplectic
  manifolds whose definition in full generality is intricate. In the
  original formulation, objects of this category are certain "branes"
  supported on Lagrangian submanifolds, and the composition laws in
  the category involve pseudo-holomorphic maps with Lagrangian
  boundary conditions (Floer theory).
  
  At the same time, a category, like any other algebraic structure,
  can admit many presentations. For instance, we could try to find a
  presentation of the Fukaya category by generators and relations, or
  we could try to build the Fukaya category of a symplectic manifold
  up from categories associated to smaller pieces of the manifold.
  
  Let $S$ be a oriented surface (2-dimensional real manifold). The
  Fukaya category of $S$ is now well-understood enough that we know
  multiple ways of presenting it. The goal of this course is to study
  the Fukaya category of $S$ via multiple presentations, the original
  Floer theoretic definition being only one of them. Others include
  the theory of "gentle algebras" (by results of
  Haiden-Katzarkov-Kontsevich), and a perspective that views the
  Fukaya category of $S$ as an object in homological algebra
  (Dyckerhoff-Kapranov).
  
  Thus, although this course will include some Floer theory, it will
  not be strictly speaking necessary in order to understand all of the
  different approaches to the Fukaya category of a surface. My hope is
  that students with different backgrounds in geometry and algebra
  will be able to find at least one way of thinking about the Fukaya
  category that makes sense to them. Applications of these ideas to
  Homological Mirror Symmetry will also be discussed.

  - *Prerequisites:* Some familiarity with the tools of algebraic
    topology is strongly recommended.
